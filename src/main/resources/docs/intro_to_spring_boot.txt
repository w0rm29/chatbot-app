Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework used to build stand-alone, production-ready applications.
It simplifies Java development by reducing boilerplate code and providing out-of-the-box configurations.
Spring Boot includes embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), making it easy to deploy applications
without needing an external web server.

Key features:
- Auto-configuration to reduce manual setup.
- Embedded servers for easy deployment.
- Spring Boot Starters to simplify dependency management.
- Production-ready monitoring with Spring Actuator.

Spring Boot is widely used for building microservices, REST APIs, and enterprise applications.
